The next thing I know, the door slams open.

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00020]
Five men burst into the lab.

Their movements are swift and sure -- professional -- and each of them is carrying a gun.

They spread out just inside the door and aim their weapons at us.


It all happens so fast, no one has time to scream.



The men are foreigners, a mix of races, dressed casually in colorful shirts and shorts or jeans.

But their arms are thick with muscle, and their eyes are hard and cold as ice.



Two of them are holding pistols. The other three have assault rifles.

AK-47s in Akiba? Is this some kind of joke?


One thing is certain. These guys aren't tourists.

<voice name="Attacker　A" class="VID_ETC" src="voice/RNA_0000" mode="on">
"Hands in the air. Nobody move."

The dark-skinned, crew-cut man barks an order.

It feels like I'm dreaming.

Did I fall asleep watching an action movie?

This is the first time so many people have gathered in this room.

Suddenly, the lab feels small. What an odd thing to be thinking at a time like this.

The first to obey is Daru.

Then Kurisu raises her hands.

Then me.

Last is Mayuri.

Silence.

Time seems to grind to a halt.

The men say nothing, but their guns remain steady, muzzles pointed at us.



On the TV, a comedian laughs.

What is this?

Are we on candid camera?


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00030]
Then I hear a new sound coming from outside.


The sound of high heels.

A woman is coming up the stairs.

Are these men waiting for her?

Is she their leader?

A squad of battle-hardened commandos lead by a beautiful woman. It's like something out of a manga.

Nothing seems real.

Before long, the woman appears.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_2725" mode="on">
"Kiryu... Moeka..."

The part-time editor.

The mail demon, Shining Finger, who is never seen without her phone.


Lab Mem 005.

Moeka? She's their leader?

The least imposing woman I've ever met?

Even now, she doesn't meet my stare. Her eyes are aimed down at the floor.

What's going on here?

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_0785" mode="on">
"Um... Moeka-san?"

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0150" mode="on">
"We're taking the time machine."

As always, her words are barely audible. 

It's ridiculous. Laughable.


And yet, I can't laugh.

My heart is a jackhammer in my chest.

The inside of my mouth is drier than a desert.


I stay still, with my hands in the air.

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0151" mode="on">
"Makise Kurisu, Okabe Rintaro, Hashida Itaru. The three of you will come with us."

I don't understand.


Why is Moeka here?

I don't know, but I have to ask.

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_2726" mode="on">
"What's going on here?"

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0152" mode="on">
"I can't answer that."

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_2727" mode="on">
"This is a joke... right?"

Moeka shakes her head.

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0153" mode="on">
"You don't need to know."

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0154" mode="on">

"W-where?"

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0156" mode="on">
"..."

No reply.

She doesn't intend to answer that either.

Dangerous.

These guys are dangerous. Look at their guns.


Nothing good can happen if we go with them.

I try to refuse, but my voice catches in my throat.

I can't stop staring at their guns.

Are they real?

They're not going to start shooting, are they?

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_2729" mode="on">
"I'm n-not going anywhere until you answer."

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0157" mode="on">

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0159" mode="on">
"We have men stationed throughout Akihabara."

Wait...

Something clicks in my head.

It was them. They sent the bomb threat. They stopped the trains.

Why?

To keep us here?

Just for that?

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0160" mode="on">
"I don't want to hurt anyone."

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0161" mode="on">
"The three of you, come with us."

<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_1665" mode="on">
"Why..."

Kurisu, who has kept silent until now, finally opens her mouth.

<voice name="Kurisu" class="VID_CRS" src="voice/CRS_1666" mode="on">
"Why just the three of us?"

That's when I realize that Mayuri wasn't included in Moeka's demand. She only wants Kurisu, Daru, and me.


<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0162" mode="on">
"I'm not answering your questions."

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0163" mode="on">
"Come with us. It's your only choice."

We're not getting anywhere.


<voice name="Itaru" class="VID_DAR" src="voice/DAR_0864" mode="on">
"O-Okarin..."

Daru's voice is shaking. I turn my head to look at him. He's deathly pale.


<voice name="Itaru" class="VID_DAR" src="voice/DAR_0865" mode="on">
"D-don't you think we should do what she says?"

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_2730" mode="on">
"But unless she tells me the reason..."

Honestly, I have no idea what to do.

My heart is still fluttering in my chest. This seems more like a dream than reality.


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00050]
I'm not a military otaku. I've never seen a real gun.

The black shine of their weapons looks somehow tacky. They lack the imposing feel you expect.

I'd believe her if she told me they were fake.

Mayuri suddenly speaks up.

<voice name="Mayuri" class="VID_MAY" src="voice/MAY_0786" mode="on">
"M-Moeka-san, you're a lab mem too... aren't you?"

It's as if Mayuri asked my question for me.

Moeka was a strange woman, but I welcomed her as a lab mem all the same.


What is she thinking right now?


</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00060]
In answer...

</PRE>

<PRE @box00>[text00070]
Moeka pulls a gun from her belt and points it at us.

I realize that Moeka isn't holding her phone. This is the first time I've seen her without it.


Not like that matters now.

Moeka's gun hand is trembling.

Is the situation affecting her too?

It must be. She's terrified of talking to people.

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0164" mode="on">
"Our mission..."

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0165" mode="on">
"Is to silence you."

Silence us?

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0166" mode="on">
"Your refusal to come will change nothing."

Does that mean she plans to kill us?

Why? What did we do?

<voice name="Rintaro" class="VID_OKA" src="voice/OKA_2731" mode="on">
"Who sent you? Who are you people!?"

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0167" mode="on">
"We..."

Moeka suddenly lifts her head.

For perhaps the third time since I've known her, she looks straight at me. Her eyes are dark and empty.




<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0168" mode="on">

Moeka raises her voice in frustration.

<voice name="Moeka" class="VID_MOE" src="voice/MOE_0171" mode="on">

Moeka slowly raises her gun.

Her delicate, frail body falls towards me.

Her body is limp, like a puppet with no strings.

Her head and arms dangle lifelessly.

The smell of gunpowder fills my nose.

You'll catch cold if you sleep here.

If you're tired, you can stay overnight.

Or I can take you home, if you prefer.


We'll ride the train back to Ikebukuro together, like we used to before Daru joined, when it was just the two of us.

"Agh!"

Pain flares in my right arm.

Was I shot?

It doesn't matter.

<PRE @box00>[text00710]
I see blue-white light shining through the smoke.

The discharge is starting!

The light rapidly grows brighter.

The floor begins to shake.

The singularity is open!

Wait for me, Mayuri!

I won't die here!

I'll cross through time to save you!

Leap, my memories.


Leap to the past!
